GameDemo
========

Our game demo for ITEC4860.

Before cloning this repo, if you also previously cloned the GameDemo repo from February of 2013, then you'll need to delete that repository folder on your machine.

Currently, only developers with Unity3D Pro can develop to a GitHub project, as the meta files make it easy enough for the GitHub project to be viable. We are currently using this with the Unity3D Pro Trial.

The .gitignore file will prevent most unnecessary files and folders from being committed, but we've yet to test the .exe and build_data folders that get generated when building this project in order to test the networking aspect. For now, it is advised to build these .exe files somewhere other than the github project folder. Unity3D will save the new location and it shouldn't be an issue.
